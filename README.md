## Description

This project allows users to solve the all time problem, "What's for Dinner?"  This application will generate a random food and a random cocktail from two different API's.  The website will show the user a picture of the food along with the name, ingredients and then a link to the recipe.  The website will also show the user a picture of the drink along with the name and ingredients.  This website allows users to be more adventureous and decisive when planning meals.  This project taught us how a group coding envirnoment works.
